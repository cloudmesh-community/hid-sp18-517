\section{Sqoop}

"Sqoop is a tool designed to transfer data between Hadoop and 
relational databases or mainframes. Sqoop can be used to import 
data from a relational database management system (RDBMS) such 
as MySQL or Oracle or a mainframe into the Hadoop Distributed 
File System (HDFS), transform the data in Hadoop MapReduce, and 
then export the data back into an RDBMS"~\cite{hid-sp18-517-Sqoop}.

Sqoop relies on the database to describe the schema of the data 
being imported. It uses MapReduce to import and export the data, 
which provides parallel operation as well as fault tolerance. 
For databases, Sqoop reads the table row-by-row into HDFS. 
For mainframe datasets, Sqoop reads records from each mainframe 
dataset into HDFS. The output of this import process is a set of 
files containing a copy of the imported table or datasets. Since 
the import process runs in parallel processes each process 
creates a file causing multiple files being created. These text 
files can use different delimiters such as comma, pipe and so on 
~\cite{hid-sp18-517-Sqoop}.
